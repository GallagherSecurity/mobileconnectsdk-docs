    "For your real system, you should generate your own certificate, do not use the sample one as.",

    "To generate the sample certificate:",
    "openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout clientprivatekey.pem -out clientcertificate.pem -days 14600",
    "   Then input appropriate details - I specified a passphrase of 'secret', you should chose a proper passphrase",

    "To obtain it's thumbprint for loading into command centre:",
    "openssl x509 -noout -fingerprint -sha1 -inform pem -in clientcertificate.pem",

    "NOTE: .NET needs to import a certificate and private key bundled together in a .pfx or .p12 file.",
    "The above openssl commands will give you seperate certificate and private key .pem files which are not enough.",

    "To combine them into a pfx file, use the following command:",
    "openssl pkcs12 -export -inkey clientprivatekey.pem -in clientcertificate.pem -out clientcertificate.pfx",
    "   Then input first the passphrase to unlock the privatekey.pem, then a second passphrase to protect the new pfx file.",
    "   I specified a passphrase of 'secret' for this sample utility, you should chose a proper passphrase",

    "If you only have a .pfx file and no pem files, you can obtain the thumbprint as follows:",
    "openssl pkcs12 -in clientcertificate.pfx | openssl x509 -noout -fingerprint"
